Installation Instructions for RXTX
The JControl/IDE needs a JAVA Communication API to communicate with a JControl device via the serial line (RS232). We recommend Trent Jarvi's RXTX package or the JAVA Communication API from Sun Microsystems.
NOTE: If you choose one of the fully integrated installer packages, the JAVA Communication API is installed automatically. Otherwise, please follow the installation procedure described below.


Windows 98/NT/2000/XP:
NOTE: It was reported that the current RXTX distribution is not working properly with Microsoft's Windows Server 2003 operating system. If you want to use Windows Server 2003 together with the JControl/IDE, please install the JAVA Communication API available at http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm and follow the installation instructions described in Readme.html.
For installing Trent Jarvi's RXTX package, please download the RXTX binaries for Windows 98/NT/2000/XP from the JControl Download Section.
